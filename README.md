Third day of the Web-Develeopment course.
Learning about HTML(HyperText Markup Language) and CSS(Cascading StyleSheets).
Trying around the dev-tools in my browser.
Currently working on my first technical web project(excited). In case you want to check it out: From The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)

Project is to recreate Google.com's homepage!

(About 11-hours later)
Wow, that took a while! Phew!
I almost had no place to start until I saw a post on the Odin forum with the solution to the project. With that webpage, much more simple and dev-tools-inspectable than Google's actual homepage, I started building my code line after line. I really enjoyed it. And even though I still wouldn't be able to do anything from memory, this has been a very good excercise. 
I can proudly say that I have by myself (almost) written my first website! I am sad that it had to be Google. I am not a fan of that data collecting mega-mega-corp!

I also feel like I am getting a hold of Git and GitHub's work-flow. All thanks to The Odin Project for creating such an intersting and interactive course!

The joy of learning somethig new!
